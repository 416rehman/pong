Written entirely in JavaScript, this classic game is as much fun to recreate as it is to play. 
I had written a Ping Pong game in C++, this time I wanted to try a web-based approach for compatibility with browsers. 
Unlike the C++ implementation, this required intercommunication of the 3 layers, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
